👨‍💻 Software Engineer | IT Grad from NJIT | Game Dev Enthusiast
Currently working as a software engineer, building real-world applications and sharpening my skills across the stack. My background includes a specialization in game development—and while I’m not building games full-time (yet), I still dive into game projects and prototypes when I can.

🛠️ Experienced with [your tech stack—e.g., JavaScript, Python, React, etc.]</br>
🎮 Love exploring game engines like Unity and messing with mechanics and design</br>
💡 Passionate about clean code, clever solutions, and creating things that people actually enjoy using</br>
**Also: certified geek for comics, movies, and all things games.**
